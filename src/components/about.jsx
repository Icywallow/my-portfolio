          Hi, I’m Simon—a Computer Science student at Monash University with a passion for web development and solving real-world problems through code. I’m always eager to learn, especially when it involves technology and building impactful solutions.

          I'm currently looking for opportunities to work with mission-driven startups or innovative companies where I can contribute and grow as a developer.

          Outside of tech, you’ll probably find me at the gym or gaming with friends. Let’s connect!
